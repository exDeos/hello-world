My exploration of GitHub and More...

* Used ahk to create some custom "small-shop" applications.
* Used python with simpy, numpy, pandas to create a single-queue call center simulation.
* Created pseudorandom evolution against known fitness functions for scheduling automation.
* Explored machine learning methods and algorithms to apply to forecasting.

An eternal hobbyist.
