# hello-world
My exploration of GitHub and More...

Lover of science fiction, science, math, and the areas where art intersects the three.
And like any true scientist, a cynic and a skeptic.
Worked in professions the past ten years and still seeking professionals.
Organizations stopping me, and saying not to go. Holding my back.
Time to rip off these chains and use them as nunchucks.
Going hard in the paint. Lights above me. Court below.
Dunk.

Used ahk to create some custom "small-shop" applications.
Used python with simpy, numpy, pandas to create a single-queue call center simulation.
Created pseudorandom evolution against known fitness functions for scheduling automation.
Exploring machine learning methods and algorithms to apply to forecasting.
  Can volumes (call centers, stock prices, any stochastic pattern) be defined as a signal?
  What kind of thinking gets applied to cutting data to outline signal from interference?
    I look at different periodicity ... How would a machine look for a better way?
  How do differential shifts (e.g. f(x)+k) and amplitudinal alteration (a\*f(x)) work in trends?
    How does the machine see and retain it distinctly from the signal?
