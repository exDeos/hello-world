# hello-world
My exploration of GitHub and More...

Lover of science fiction, science, math, and the areas where art intersects the three.
And like any true scientist, a cynic and a skeptic.
Worked in a profession the past five years and still seeking real professionals.
Thinking it's the wrong profession.
Time to rip off these chains and use them as nunchucks.
Going hard in the paint. Lights above me. Court below.
Dunk.

Used ahk to create some custom "small-shop" applications.
Used python with simpy, numpy, pandas to create a single-queue call center simulation.
  Currently working to develop multi-queue simulation tailored for Cisco UCCX 9-11 env.
Created pseudorandom schedule generation against known fitness functions for scheduling automation.
Exploring machine learning methods and algorithms to apply to forecasting.
  Can volumes (call centers, stock prices, any stochastic pattern) be defined as a signal?
  What kind of thinking gets applied to cutting the data to produce a proper frequency?
    I look daily, weekly, seasonally ... How would a machine look for a better way?
  How does differential shifts (e.g. f(x)+k) and amplitudinal alteration (a*f(x)) work in?
    How does the machine see and retain it distinctly from the signal?
